# markovchain

This is a general-purpose Go implementation of [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Specifically, it can build Markov chains from a stream of states and then sample from that chain. As a result, it is good for tasks like text prediction and generation.

# Text example

The [textchain](textchain/) directory includes a program which uses a Markov chain on text to produce more text. Here is some example output with a history size of 2, generated using Wikipedia articles:
